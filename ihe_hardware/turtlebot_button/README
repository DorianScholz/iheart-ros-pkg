Setup:

Add the header file for Button.msg to Arduino libraries:

    rosrun rosserial_client make_library.py PATH_TO_ARDUINO_LIBRARY turtlebot_button



To run:

1) Upload buttons_turtlebot/buttons_turtlebot.ino onto an Arduino. (Currently 
   not compatiable with Leonardo.)
2) Run the rosserial client that forwards the message to the rest of ROS.

       rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py SERIAL_PORT
